#Mexican food api 🌮🌶️🌯
A small project created to practice API development in Java
Even though it’s not my favorite language, it’s an important one, and I genuinely enjoy working with it.

The API I use focuses on Mexican food, providing data about traditional dishes, ingredients, and more.
It’s mainly a learning playground, but I aim to keep the code clean and readable

This project is still current and isn't finished yet.
